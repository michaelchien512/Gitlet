# Gitlet

Gitlet is a version-control system analogous to Git. It is capable of the basic Git commands such as adding, commiting, restoring versions of files, maintaing sequences of commits through branches, and much more listed down below.
Gitlet uses several of the same object git uses to keep track of data such as blobs, trees, and commits. Each commit and blob 
is given a unique integer ID using a cryptographic hash funciton called SHA-1 (Secure Hash 1) capable of produdcing a 160-bit 
integer hash function from a sequence of bytes.
